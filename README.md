E-Commerce API Project
This project is a RESTful API developed to learn modern backend development and enhance my skills with Spring Boot. The API provides core e-commerce functionalities such as user management, product management, and cart operations. My goal was to gain hands-on experience with the Spring ecosystem, database management, API design, and security practices.

Project Purpose and Learning Objectives
Through this project, I aimed to learn and apply the following technologies and concepts:

Spring Boot: Building RESTful APIs, dependency injection, and application configuration.
Spring Data JPA: Utilizing Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for database operations.
MySQL: Designing and managing relational databases.
Spring Security: Implementing API security, authentication, and authorization.
REST API Design: Working with HTTP methods (GET, POST), endpoint design, and JSON data formats.
Error Handling: Creating user-friendly error messages and exception management.
Postman: Testing and validating APIs.
Maven: Managing project dependencies and configuration.
Git/GitHub: Version control and code sharing.
This project was designed as a learning tool to improve my technical skills and build a backend system applicable to real-world scenarios.
